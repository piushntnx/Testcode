These testcodes are to check concurrency in puppet apply.

1. Download all the files on an AHV host
2. Run setup.sh script to copy the files to the right directories
3. Run run.sh script to execute parallel concurrent "puppet apply"
4. Check the puppet log in /tmp/puppetlog file and output of successful execution in /tmp/new. 

Here we are running 5 puppet apply concurrently and each of them are executing their own bash scripts. But all of their bash scripts take lock on a common 
file /tmp/templock. So, each of these puppet apply will have to wait for the lock and then complete their execution. 

Observation: No puppet appply fails as it does in the puppet ticket: https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/si/jira.issueviews:issue-html/PUP-5609/PUP-5609.html saying:
"Notice: Run of Puppet already in progress; skipping  (/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/state/agent_catalog_run.lock exists)"


Content of /tmp/new should look like:
Fri May 21 21:30:55 UTC 2021 : Test2
Fri May 21 21:31:05 UTC 2021 : Test1
Fri May 21 21:31:15 UTC 2021 : Test4
Fri May 21 21:31:25 UTC 2021 : Test3
Fri May 21 21:31:35 UTC 2021 : Test5

Output in /tmp/puppetlog should look like:
